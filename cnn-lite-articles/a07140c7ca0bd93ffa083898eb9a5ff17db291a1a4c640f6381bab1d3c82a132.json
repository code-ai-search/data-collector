And it’s going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.”\n\nThe planes which serve as Air Force One have been painted a baby blue and white livery sincethe Kennedy administration, and Trump’s proposed change sparked speculation that he intended to replicate the colors of his personal Boeing 757.\n\nIn 2022, during the Biden administration,the livery was rejectedby the Air Force citing cost and technical reasons.\n\n“Further analysis concluded darker colors, among other factors, on the underside of the VC-25B aircraft might contribute to temperatures exceeding the current qualification limits of a small number of components,” a spokesperson said at the time.\n\nThe military proposednew renderings in 2023 of a design selected by Bidenwhich looked very similar to the baby blue livery in use for more than 60 years, with a slightly darker tint.\n\nWhen Trump was reelected his Air Force One paint scheme was again front and center, displayed on the evening of his inauguration on top of a cake at the Commander In Chief Ball. Now, it is often seen in a model on the coffee table in the Oval Office.A Department of Homeland Security Boeing 737also started flying with a similar paint job last year.\n\nNow, the Air Force says the livery will be applied to two new Boeing 747s being modified by Boeing and a 747 donated to the military by Qatar, which Trump has ordered be retrofitted for use as Air Force One.  The Qatari jet could be flyingas early as this summer.\n\nThe colors will also be applied during scheduled maintenance to four of the smaller C-32 aircraft, a military version of the Boeing 757, currently in the fleet.\n\nA C-32 wearing the new paint scheme was photographed by plane spotter @TT33Operator taking off from Greenville, Texas, earlier this week and reported by the military news website TWZ.\n\nThe Air Force confirms one of the aircraft has been painted and is expected to be delivered within a few months.\n\nCNN’s Arlette Saenz, Jamie Ehrlich Priscilla Alvarez, Pete Muntean Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
