  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche pledged last month that the Justice Department was not protecting anyone — least of all Donald Trump.\n\nThose assurances by the president’s former personal lawyer are facing new scrutiny following remarkable developments in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n\nIntrigue deepened after lawmakers emerged perplexed after being given the chance toread unredacted versionsof blacked-out investigative files previously released to the public in massive document dumps compelled by Congress.\n\n“We didn’t want there to be a cover-up, and yet what I saw today was that there were lots of examples of people’s names being redacted when they were not victims,” Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said.\n\nThe lawmakers started inspecting the documents at the DOJ on a day of broadening fallout from a scandal that has blown the lid off the late sex offender’s stunning global network of billionaires and powerbrokers.\n\nWhile new concerns surfaced over the DOJ’s handling of the files and the case more generally, the push for accountability raced ahead in Europe, where the political careers and reputations of powerful people are in shreds.\n\nAnd suspicions among survivors that their long quest for justice is being impeded yet again were reinforced by an extraordinary offer made to Trump bya lawyer for Epstein’s jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The gist was this: Grant clemency to Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker, and she’ll put the president in the clear.\n\nLawmakers who were able to seesome unredacted copies of the Epstein filesdid not directly accuse the DOJ of a cover-up. But their findings will only fuel mistrust among many of their colleagues and the public about its handling of the case. This is especially so since the names of many people linked to Epstein were redacted in public disclosures, while the names of some victims were visible.\n\nAfter pressure from lawmakers, the Justice Department un-redacted some more names in the Epstein files on Monday, with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that they redacted the identities of several people named in a 2019 document that listed Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.\n\nBlanche, in anonline exchangewith Massie on Monday night, said that the Justice Department is “hiding nothing.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. James Walkinshaw demanded answers. “I can say that I saw many names, including names in emails to and from Jeffrey Epstein, that suggests these individuals were involved in crimes or at least knew about crimes,” the Virginia lawmaker told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “And again, I’m not able to explain why they were redacted in a way that’s consistent with the law.”\n\nRaskin said the department hadn’t explained why certain redactions were made, but that he saw “a whole bunch of them that seemed very suspicious and baffling to me.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz told reporters he’d seen “lots of names, lots of co-conspirators and they’re trafficking girls all across the world.”\n\nDOJ was supposed to limit redactions to the personal information of victims and materials that would jeopardize an active criminal investigation. And Congress has not yet received a privileged log from DOJ explaining why certain redactions were made, which DOJ is compelled to provide 15 days after its January 30 release of documents.\n\nThe experience of lawmakers means an even tougher reception for Attorney General Pam Bondi when she testifies to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Many Democrats already believe that her department, whether by design or omission, is failing to honor the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed after a GOP revolt against Trump last year.\n\nThe law’s authors, California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Massie, expressed disappointment with the DOJ.\n\nIt was another stunning day of Epstein fallout on Monday.\n\nMaxwell was piped in from her detention facility in Texas to provide testimony to a House committee investigating the scandal, but she invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination, as is her constitutional right.\n\nBut her lawyer made a stunning proposal. “Ms. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,” attorney David Oscar Markus said in a statement during the deposition, which he later posted on X.\n\n“Only she can provide the complete account,” Markus continued. “Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing.”\n\nNeither the current nor the ex-president has been charged with any crime in connection to Epstein. Both deny having had knowledge of his offenses.\n\nTrump has struggled to explain his friendship with the disgraced financier and said he threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club after they became estranged.\n\nBut the clemency play is the epitome of an age when attempted quid pro quos play out in public in hopes of swaying a president who mocks ethics and exploits power granted by voters for his own ends. Anything that Maxwell said in the event she was released from prison would be immediately regarded as not credible, given her incentive to improve her own plight. But such is Trump’s outlandish past use of his pardon powers that her gambit cannot be dismissed. It might even work.\n\nThe atmosphere of thwarted accountability on one side of the Atlantic only sharpened the contrast with an extraordinary political crisis engulfing Britain.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmerbattled to save his job amid recriminations over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson, a former Epstein friend, as ambassador to Washington. And in a mind-boggling move, King Charles III offered to cooperate with police in any investigations into his brother, the former Prince Andrew, who has had his royal titles stripped after he obfuscated his ties to Epstein.\n\nUnderscoring the peril the affair poses to the monarchy, the heir to the throne, Prince William, and his wife, Princess Catherine,offered empathy to Epstein survivorsthrough a spokesperson.\n\nIn Norway, where another royal has been shamed by the affair, authorities said they were investigating a former diplomat suspected of “gross corruption.” The reputation of a highly respectedformer French culture ministerwas tarnished by his past contact with Epstein. AndPolandis investigating whether the convicted sex offender was linked to Russian spies.\n\nKhanna marveled at the contrast between the UK and the US.\n\n“Look at what’s happening in Britain. You have a left government — actually, I know Keir Starmer, I was excited when he won, and yet I believe he needs to be held accountable with what’s happened with Mandelson. You have the British monarchy having to answer questions — I mean, the King of England is putting out statements. And yet in our country we have not had that reckoning.”\n\nWhat explains the difference?\n\nIt’s complex, especially since none of the people who came into contact with Epstein, apart from Maxwell, have been charged with crimes. That doesn’t necessarily point to a cover-up. Evidence may not lead in such a direction.\n\nBut the growing push for accountability is raising the question of what this network of powerful and sophisticated people — mostly rich men — knew about Epstein’s activities and crimes, especially once he emerged from prison in 2009 after serving a 13-month sentence for sex offenses.\n\nThere have been some consequences for Americans who had links with Epstein. Former Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers stepped away from public life after the release of embarrassing email exchanges with Epstein. Last week, Brad Karp resigned as chairman of Paul Weiss, one of the country’s top corporate law firms, over Epstein ties.\n\nBut such downfalls in the United States have been precipitated by reputational damage to individuals rather than government action. In Europe, the machinery of investigation and accountability remains independent. In the US, the Justice Department is run by Trump loyalists who’ve heard his calls for the country to move on.\n\nMandelson is facing a criminal investigationover allegations he passed secret and market-moving government information to Epstein. It’s hard to see the Trump DOJ launching a probe in similar circumstances. Mandelson has apologized for his past links with Epstein and has resigned from the Labour Party and the House of Lords.\n\nThe shock over disclosures about Epstein’s behavior and his sprawling network of contacts is palpable in Europe.\n\nBut why is disgust less obvious in the United States? Perhaps, 10 years into the Trump era, the country is just punch-drunk on scandal. Or maybe the spectacle of Epstein’s influence-peddling isn’t such big news in a nation where politics is saturated in campaign cash.\n\nEach day brings new revelations about Epstein’s extraordinary global network of interlocking ties between bipartisan political leaders and influencers, finance and business titans, international organizations, academia and billionaires.\n\nBut amid the cacophony, people often forget what this is really about: grievous harm inflicted on the women who were trafficked by Epstein as girls and forced to perform massages and sex acts. Their trauma is only exacerbated by the apparent impunity of powerful people who flocked around their abuser.\n\n“I think that what people also need to remember is that, you know, the survivors of this crime know what happened,” Epstein victim Liz Stein, wearing a sweater reading “Courage is Contagious,” told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday. “And so when we see things coming out that, you know don’t parallel what our truth is, we really — we’re taking notice.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
