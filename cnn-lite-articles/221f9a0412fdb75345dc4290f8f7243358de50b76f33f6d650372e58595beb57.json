  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nSince returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has made a major push to put America’s elite universitieson noticeover political ideology. But the groundwork for the White House’s stronger stance was laid more than a year earlier.\n\nTwo months after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel sparked theGaza war— andprotestsat colleges over the siege and the US ally’s retaliatory bombardment of the territory — the then-president of Harvard University wasaskedin a congressionalhearingwhether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate Harvard’s rules against bullying and harassment.\n\n“It can be, depending on the context,” Claudine Gaysaidin a response that slackened the jaws of many students and donors and deeply divided the campus and itsalumni.\n\nGay laterapologized. But the backlash, plus a plagiarism scandal, ultimately led her toresign, with Jewish organizations agreeing the nation’soldest,wealthiestandmost prestigiousuniversity wasn’t takingantisemitismseriously enough.\n\nThe reaction also provided a fresh line of criticism forconservative groupsandpoliticianswho for decades hadcomplainedabout liberal teachings at ivory tower institutions.\n\nHarvard soon launched atask forceon antisemitism thatcalledfor stronger action against “harassment, abuse and intimidation” and more consistent discipline for violators. Since then, the schoolsaysit has tightened its ban on encampments and other protests that disrupt student activities,made“doxing” a violation of its anti-harassment and anti-bullying rules and expanded “inclusion and belonging efforts” to include Jewish students.\n\nStill, the Trump administration’s claims of campus antisemitism continue to dog Harvard, with the White House making sweeping policy demands of its leaders while threatening billions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League and Harvard’s Hillel chapter have expressed appreciation for the administration’s focus on antisemitism but also decried funding cuts asoverreachwith the potential toharm Jewish students.\n\nWhile such pressure has yielded changes atother American universities, Harvard has refused to comply and is the first institution tosuethe Republican administration – and win, at least at the district level – claiming it violated federal procedures and the First Amendment.\n\nHere’s a timeline of key events in the Harvard dispute:\n\nJanuary 29:Days into his second term, Trump signs anexecutive ordercalling for tougher enforcement of government efforts against antisemitism. Since the October 7, 2023, attack, “Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault,” the order says.\n\nNo specific universities are mentioned, but top administration officials are told to recommend how higher education institutions should “monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff” and how the government “if warranted, (take) actions to remove such aliens” under federal legal authority that covers any foreigner who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity.”\n\nThe administration will cite the executive order repeatedly in pressuring Harvard to change its policies and separately will use claims of participation in pro-Palestinian protests or other claims without evidence to move todeportorrevoke the visasof foreign scholars.\n\nFebruary 3:The Department of Justiceannouncesthe creation of amultiagencyTask Force to Combat Anti-Semitism led by Leo Terrell, a lawyer and former talk radio host who, upon his appointment by Trump as an assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Department of Justice,retweeted an X postcalling him “HARVARD’S WORST NIGHTMARE.”\n\nFebruary 27:The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sends a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber demanding a meeting within 30 days with “relevant administrators, faculty, staff members, and any on-campus Jewish stakeholder groups” relative to Trump’s executive order on curbing antisemitism.\n\n“(W)e write to notify you that we are aware of allegations that your institution may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty members from unlawful discrimination, in potential violation of statutes that we enforce,” says the letter signed by Terrell.\n\nFebruary 28:The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitismannouncesit will visit 10 university campuses to “meet with university leadership, impacted students and staff, local law enforcement, and community members.” Harvard is among them.\n\nMarch 8:“We’re going to bankrupt these universities. We’re going to take away every single federal dollar,” Terrell tellsFox Newsregarding institutions he accuses of permitting antisemitism, adding, “If these universities do not play ball, lawyer up, because the federal government is coming after you.”\n\nMarch 10:Harvard is included in a list of 60 schools receivinglettersfrom the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, advising them they areunder investigationfor potential Civil Rights Act violations “relating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.”\n\n“US colleges and universities benefit from enormous public investments funded by US taxpayers,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon says in a statement. “That support is a privilege, and it is contingent on scrupulous adherence to federal antidiscrimination laws.”\n\nMarch 31:The General Services Administration notifies Harvard it is conducting an official review “of all Federal contracts and grants,” with “greater than $8.7 billion of multi-year grant commitments” to be reviewed, according to a memo and an email from an agency commissioner, Josh Gruenbaum. “The Federal Government reserves the right to terminate for convenience any contracts it has with your institution at any time during the period of performance,” the memo says.\n\nApril 1:Trump speaks favorably of the idea of cutting off all federal funding to Harvard,The New York Timeslater reported. “Wouldn’t that be cool?” the president says in a private interaction at the White House, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nApril 3:The GSA’s Gruenbaum tells Harvard’s Garber via email, “I am sending you an official notice of pre-conditions your institution must comply with in order to be in good standing and continue to be the recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.”\n\nAttached to the email is a two-page letter also signed by attorneys with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education with “immediate next steps that we regard as necessary for Harvard University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”\n\nIn addition to demanding further steps to prevent antisemitism and punish those who discriminate against Jewish people, the letter demands Harvard “cease all preferences based on race, color, or national origin” in admissions and hiring, make efforts to “shutter” DEI programs and improve “viewpoint diversity.”\n\nApril 11:The Trump administration sends a newletterexpanding on the April 3 correspondence. In stronger language, the same attorneys write, “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.”\n\nThat is followed by a proposed four-page “agreement in principle” of demands. They include Harvard reform its international student program “to prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism,” and report to the federal government any foreign student who commits conduct violations.\n\nThe proposed agreement would also require Harvard to pay for outside review through 2028 of the school’s “viewpoint diversity” and hire a “critical mass of new faculty” if it is not found to be sufficiently diverse. Additionally, the previous email’s requirement of “efforts” to close DEI programs is made mandatory by August.\n\nApril 14:Harvard publicly releases the April 11 letter as well as aresponsefrom Garber, who categorically refuses the proposal, saying the government’s demands would violate the First Amendment. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” he writes.\n\n“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”\n\nWhile the administration confirms the legitimacy of its April 11 letter, a senior official latertold the New York Timesit was intended to continue negotiations. “It was malpractice on the side of Harvard’s lawyers not to pick up the phone and call the members of the antisemitism task force who they had been talking to for weeks,” May Mailman, the White House senior policy strategist, said to the Times.\n\nOn the same day, the Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitismannounces“a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 (million) in multi-year contract value” to Harvard in response to the school’s actions. “Within hours of the Freeze Order, Harvard began receiving stop work orders,” the university says in its lawsuit.\n\nApril 15:Trump says in aTruth Social post: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’”\n\nShortly afterward, the Internal Revenue Servicebegins making plansto rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status. The idea “was certainly worth looking into,” McMahon, the education secretary, tells CNN.\n\nApril 16:The Department of Homeland SecuritythreatenstorevokeHarvard’s certification to participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, jeopardizing the enrollment of thousands of international students. “It is a privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee,”readsthe letter.\n\nApril 17:The Department of Education sends arecords requestto Harvard demanding information on all overseas gifts, plus information relating to “expelled foreign students,” effectively reviving a four-year investigationclosedat the end of the Biden administration, with Harvard agreeing to update its financial disclosures.\n\n“Critical aspects of Harvard’s recent foreign funding disclosure submissions are a cause for concern with the Department,” the lettersays.\n\nApril 21:Harvardsues the Trump administration, calling threats to its federal funding a violation of the First Amendment, as well as “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\n“HHS has not notified Harvard of, or provided any justification for, the imposition of any additional conditions on any specific grants,” the lawsuit says, adding the White House hasfailed to follow the lawon how grants can be canceled.\n\nApril 22:Still, the Trump administration considers itself to be in an ongoing negotiation with Harvard and other universities, and the demands in the letters sent to Harvard are part of the back-and-forth, the education secretary reiterates.\n\n“We had hoped Harvard would come back to the table to discuss these. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” McMahon tells CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” The April 11 letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.”\n\nApril 23:Harvard asks a federal judge to fast-track its legal challenge to the funding freeze, arguing it threatens critical research and academic endeavors and “chills Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights,” its filing states.\n\nApril 25:The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission opens a civil rights investigation into Harvard, the Wall Street Journalreports. A memo from Commissioner Andrea Lucas cites Harvard’s efforts to diversify its faculty and scholarships designated for “underrepresented minorities” as examples of potential civil rights violations against White, Asian, male and straight applicants.\n\nHarvard declines comment on the report and refers CNN to Garber’s earlierstatement: “We do not have quotas, whether based on race or ethnicity or any other characteristic. We do not employ ideological litmus tests. We do not use diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in our hiring decisions.”\n\nApril 28:Both sidesappear in courtfor the first time in Harvard’s suit as US District Court JudgeAllison Burroughs, a Barack Obama appointee, sets oral arguments for July 21 in the case. Since Harvard has not requested an emergency order to reverse thefunding freeze, it is likely to remain in effect until the judge issues a final ruling — unless the Trump administration changes its mind before then.\n\nHarvardannouncesit is changing the name of its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to Community and Campus Life. “We must sharpen our focus on fostering connections across difference, creating spaces for dialogue, and cultivating a culture of belonging — not as an abstract ideal, but as a lived experience for all,” its leader, Sherri Ann Charleston, says in an email to the campus community.\n\nCharleston also tells a number of affinity groups the university is dropping support for their commencement ceremonies following a warning from the Education Department about events for specific races, the Harvard Crimson student newspaperreports.\n\nThe Trump administrationannouncesit is launching investigations into the Harvard Law Review, saying authorities have gotten complaints about race-based discrimination. The “article selection process appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission,” a top Education Department official says.\n\nApril 29:Two Harvard task forcesreleasea pair of long-awaited internal reports: one onhow antisemitism and anti-Israeli biasare handled on campus and another onanti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias. “I am sorry for the moments when we failed to meet the high expectations we rightfully set for our community,” Garberwritesof the “disappointing and painful” 2023-24 school year. The reports include broad recommendations and policy changes for admissions and programs.\n\nApril 30:A White House official calls the task force’s recommendations “positive.” But “what we’re seeing is not enough, and there’s actually probably going to be additional funding being cut,”the official tells CNN.\n\nMeanwhile, Harvard provides “information required by law” on international students to the Department of Homeland Security, anopen letterfrom Harvard Executive Vice President Meredith Weenick says, more than a week after agency Secretary Kristi Noemdemanded detailedinformation, including “each student visa holder’s known illegal activity” as well as their “dangerous or violent activity.”\n\nHarvard does not specify whether it provided all the information demanded by Noem, who threatened to remove Harvard from the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program, known as SEVP, if it did not respond. “Our participation in SEVP is unchanged at this time, and any withdrawal by DHS of Harvard’s certification would be involuntary,” Weenick writes.\n\nMay 2:Trump says in an online post he will revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status, repeating his April 15 threat. “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!” the presidentannounceson Truth Social.\n\n“There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status,” a university spokesperson responded to CNN. “Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation.”\n\nMay 5:The Trump administration announces it is cutting off all new federal research grants to Harvard. McMahonsends a letterto Garber on Monday evening conveying that the university is not eligible for grants from the federal government due to its “consistent violations of its own legal duties.”\n\nThe letter cites ongoing issues between the university and the administration, such as affirmative action and protesting on campus, as well as criticizingthe temporary removal of standardized testingsuch as the SAT or ACT, which wasreinstated in April 2024, and overall management of the university.\n\nMcMahon’s letter also notes hedge fund CEOBill Ackmancalled for the resignation ofPenny Pritzker, the leader of the Harvard Corporation that controls the university’s operations. Ackman accuses Pritzker of mismanagement and says that “any serious corporation would have removed her after a litany of recent failings.”\n\nMay 6:Harvard stands by Pritzker. “We applaud her dedicated stewardship and her leadership at a time when Harvard is committed both to strengthening our campus culture and protecting the academic freedom, research and innovation that benefits millions of Americans,” Garber and the Harvard Corporation tell the Wall Street Journal in a statement.\n\nMay 12:Responding to McMahon, Garberwritesthat while Harvard and the Trump Administration share “common ground” on issues such as ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus and encouraging a “multiplicity of viewpoints” at the Ivy League school, the “overreach” of the federal government has hindered those objectives.\n\n“Harvard’s efforts to achieve these goals are undermined and threatened by the federal government’s overreach into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and its continuing disregard of Harvard’s compliance with the law,” his letter says.\n\nMay 13:An additional freeze of about$450 million in federal fundingpledged to Harvard isannouncedby the government Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\n“There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support,” says the statement signed by attorneys for the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe task force says the new cancellation in funding involves eight federal agencies, but does not provide specifics.\n\nMay 14:Harvard announces Garber will voluntarily take a25% pay cutfor a year starting in July. While his salary isn’t public, Harvard presidents have earned upward of $1 million, according toThe Crimson.\n\nMay 15:The Department of Energy issues a notice to Harvard terminating about $89 million in grant funding from its Office of Science and Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy “due to the University’s policy of racial discrimination.” In a letter to Garber, the department also cites “Harvard’s ongoing inaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students.”\n\nMay 19:The Department of Justiceannouncesplans to use the False Claims Act to crack down on diversity initiatives at US colleges. Amemofrom Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche cites allowing antisemitism on campus and lettingtransgender women compete in sportsamong potential violations that could result in the loss of federal money.\n\nBlanche also “strongly encourages” private citizens to file lawsuits against institutions they believe are violating civil rights laws to claw back federal funds.\n\nMay 22:The Department of Homeland SecurityrevokesHarvard’s certification in theStudent and Exchange Visitor Program, making it impossible for the university to enroll international students, whichcomprisemore than a quarter of its enrollment. Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, accuses the school of failing to turn over student conduct information her agency demanded and of “permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals.”\n\n“The government’s action is unlawful,” Harvard responds in a statement. “We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University — and this nation — immeasurably.”\n\nMay 23:Harvardsues to stopthe Trump administration from carrying out its revocation of the school’s certification to enroll foreign students, and within four hours, Burroughs – now alsoassigned as the judgein this separate lawsuit — issues atemporary restraining orderagainst the government in the case.\n\n“With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body,” Harvard’s lawsuit says, arguing the Trump administration’s actions have been in “clear retaliation” for actions protected by the First Amendment.\n\n“The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin says in a statement. “We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”\n\nMay 26:Trump in an online post threatensto shift $3 billionin Harvard’s federal grant funding to US trade schools over its handling of anti-Israel protests. The president also accuses Harvard of “judge shopping” Burroughs, even as the Massachusetts school would be expected to bring such lawsuits in Boston’s federal court.\n\nMay 27:The federal government is poised to direct its agencies to move to cancel about $100 million incontractsto Harvard, two senior Trump administration officials tell CNN. The directive, expected to be issued in a letter from the General Services Administration, will order government agencies to look for new vendors for the federal funds, the officials say.\n\nMay 28:Trump suggests international students should beno more than 15%of Harvard’s enrollees. “We have people (who) want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there,” he tells reporters in the Oval Office. The president also implies, without evidence, that some foreign students included in Harvard’s records will be “very radical people.”\n\nMay 29:The Trump administrationsaysin a last-minute court filing it will give Harvard 30 days to present its case for why it should stay in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program,tellingBurroughs there’s no reason for a further court order while that review is underway. But Harvard’s attorney disagrees, and so does Burroughs,orderingHarvard’s international student program to remain “status quo” while the court case plays out.\n\nAt the same time as the hearing, nearly 9,000 students receive their degrees in a graduation ceremony that frequently touches on the fraught political moment for Harvard. Garber, the university president praised for his willingness to take on the White House in court,receivesa minute-long standing ovation.\n\n“Part of what makes America great, if I may use that phrase, is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom,”sayskeynote speakerDr. Abraham Verghese.\n\nJune 4:Trumpsigns a proclamationto suspend visas for new students at Harvard, alleging the university has “concerning foreign ties” and arguing that hisadministration is attempting to “safeguard national security.”\n\nThe proclamation suspends the entry of any new Harvard student as a nonimmigrant under F, M or J visas and “directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing F, M, or J visas for current Harvard students who meet the Proclamation’s criteria,” the White House says in a statement.\n\nJune 5:Harvard amends its existing international student lawsuit against the Trump administration, asking the court to stop the enforcement of Trump’s proclamation less than 24 hours after it was signed. The amended suit claims the proclamation violates the First Amendment and asks the court for emergency intervention.\n\nHours later,Burroughs agreesand issues a temporary restraining order against Trump’s proclamation, ruling that Harvard would “sustain immediate and irreparable injury” if she did not do so. The judge also sets a hearing for mid-June to hear arguments over whether she should block Trump’s proclamation indefinitely.\n\nJune 6:Trumprepeatsthe administration’s demand for alistof Harvard’s international students, information the governmentalready has. “I think they’re starting to behave actually, if you want to know the truth,” the president adds of the school.\n\nJune 10:The Trump administration is “making progress in some of the discussion,” McMahonsays, citing Harvard’s replacement of the head of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, alate Marchmove that predated the White House’s most pointed demands. “College ought to be about the exchange of ideas and debate … It has to be done peacefully,” the education secretary adds. As to any further demands of Harvard, she says, “At this particular time, we’re continuing with the things we’ve already talked about.”\n\nJune 12:Harvard and the Trump administration tell Judge Burroughs in separate court filings that they have been unable to come to an agreement on the specifics of her proposed court order to preserve the “status quo” of the school’s international student program, despite lengthy negotiations.\n\nThe most significant sticking point is that Harvardwantsany future change to their SEVP status to be automatically delayed by 30 days to give them a chance to dispute it in court. The governmentsaysthe court should not automatically block their decisions on Harvard’s international students “without knowing what the outcome or reasoning will be.”\n\nJune 20:Burroughsissues a preliminary injunctionagainst the Trump administration, indefinitely undoing its effort to block Harvard from enrolling international students. The government is ordered “to restore every visa holder and applicant to the position that individual would have been absent … (the SEVP) Revocation Notice” as the case continues. Burroughs does not make a final ruling on whether the order was unconstitutional.\n\nJune 30:The Trump administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitismfindsthat Harvard is in “violent violation” of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and threatens further loss of federal resources. The task force says Harvard “has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a willful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff.” Harvard responds it’s “far from indifferent and strongly disagrees” with the report’s conclusion.\n\nJuly 10:Websites for Harvard College centers serving women, minority and LGBTQ studentsvanish, The Harvard Crimson reports. They redirect to a page for an Office of Culture and Community, a replacement for the soon-to-close diversity office for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that promotes “(e)xposure to and learning from different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.” The White House views the development as a goodwill gesture, with one official describing it as “good news.”\n\nJuly 21:Judge Burroughshears argumentsin court from the Trump administration and Harvard attorneys over whether the federal government must restore frozen grant money to the university.\n\nThe school calls the funding decision a “blatant and unrepentant violation” of the First Amendment. A government attorney says it was not a constitutional issue, but rather a contract dispute, and the university “should’ve read the fine print.”\n\nJuly 23:The State Departmentannouncesa new investigation into Harvard’s participation in the J-1 exchangevisaprogram, which the universitysaysincludes “professors, researchers, specialists and students.”\n\n“To maintain their privilege to sponsor exchange visitors, sponsors must comply with all regulations, including conducting their programs in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States,” says a written statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nSeptember 3:Burroughsrulesthe government’s freeze of federal funding to Harvard violates the law and infringes on Harvard’s First Amendment rights. “A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities,” the judge writes.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately announces an appeal, with a White House spokesperson calling Burroughs an “activist Obama-appointed judge (who) was always going to rule in Harvard’s favor, regardless of the facts.”\n\n•September 30:President Donald Trump says officialsare “very close” to a deal with Harvard, and the university “will be paying about $500 million and they’ll be operating trade schools.”\n\nThe president broadly describes the contours of the deal, describing it as a “series of trade schools” that “would be run by Harvard.” Harvard declines to comment on potential negotiations\n\n• February 2, 2026:President Donald Trump dramatically increases his demands on Harvard, demanding the school to paya $1 billion settlementafter months of failed negotiations. The sudden change comes shortly after aNew York Times reportsaid the president was prepared to drop a demand for $200 million in cash as part of a settlement.\n\n• February 13, 2026:The Trump administrationfiles a lawsuit against Harvard, asking a judge to force the university to turn over student admissions information in its investigation of whether the Ivy League school discriminated against students in its admissions decisions.\n\n“Providing requested data is a basic expectation of any credible compliance process, and refusal to cooperate creates concerns about university practices,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon in a statement.\n\nHarvard responded it had been providing documents to the government “in good faith,” adding, “The University will continue to defend itself against these retaliatory actions which have been initiated simply because Harvard refused to surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to unlawful government overreach.”\n\nSee Full Web Article",
