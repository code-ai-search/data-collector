  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nAttorney GeneralPam Bondi’s testimonyin front of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday was some of the tensest and most combative testimony we’ve seen to date from a Trump Cabinet official.\n\nBondi came into the hearing with the administration and DOJ facing a series of problems, including their handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, the newly reported failed indictments of six Democratic lawmakers, and the killing of two protesters by federal officers in Minneapolis last month.\n\nBelow are some takeaways from the hearing:\n\nEarly in the hearing, Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington asked Epstein survivors in the audience to stand up. And she challenged Bondi on a difficult issue.\n\nShe asked Bondi, who had just apologized to the survivors for the abuse they suffered, toalsoapologize to them for the Justice Department’sfailures to redact survivors’ sensitive personal information.\n\nBondi paused, as if considering her next move. Then, rather than apologize, she launched into a deflection about her predecessor as attorney general, Merrick Garland. The exchange quickly devolved into arguments and personal attacks.\n\nIt was a telling moment. The Justice Department has acknowledged these redaction failures. And the survivors are some of the most sympathetic figures imaginable. But Bondi decided the moment called for combativeness, not contrition.\n\nThe rest of the hearing flowed from there. Bondi was extremely combative throughout, doing whatever she could to avoid Democrats’ and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie’s questions about Epstein — in ways that might seem politically unwise.\n\nShe also refused Democrats’ repeated entreaties to address the survivors seated behind her — survivors who said DOJ had ignored them — which made for some compelling visuals.\n\nShe called a Democrat a “washed up, loser lawyer.” She berated another for attacking “the greatest president in American history,” Trump.\n\nWhen Bondi claimed there was “no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime,” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California pointed to an unsubstantiated tip about Trump from the Epstein files — something he said counts as evidence  — and accused Bondi of lying under oath and called for her to resign. Bondi suggested the lawmaker should focus on “horrific crimes in California” instead.\n\nAnd when another lawmaker urged her again to consider the survivors sitting nearby, rather than responding she pointed to the expired clock, saying, “Your time is up.”\n\nShe talked over her interrogators so much that Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan had to repeatedly remind her that the time belonged to the members, not her.\n\nIt seemed Bondi was playing to the “audience of one” — Trump. But that came potentially at the expense of appealing to an American public that really does want answers.\n\nA recent poll, after all, showed Americansdisapprove about 3-to-1of the administration’s handling of the Epstein files.\n\nThe combativeness was normal for Bondi, but it risked looking out of place and like she wasn’t taking a serious issue seriously.\n\nSo many Trump officials right now seem to be choosing between doing his bidding and doing what might otherwise seem wise. And Bondi’s performance Wednesday was a case in point.\n\nBut Bondi couldn’t just go after Democrats. After all, some Republicans have pressed her and her department on this issue.\n\nAnd an exchange with Massie, the lead Republican behind the Epstein files effort, stood out when it came to actually pinning down the administration.\n\nThe Kentuckian pointed to another big redactions issue: How the administration appeared toerrantly redact some menwhom law enforcement at one point appeared to suspect of criminal activity with Epstein. Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California have cited six of them, including billionaire business magnate Les Wexner.\n\n(Wexner has not been accused of a crime, anda representative has saidhe cooperated with law enforcement and was told he “was neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect.”)\n\nBondi noted, as the administration has, that Wexner’s name appeared elsewhere in the documents. But Massie referred to that as a red herring — that the Justice Department happened to redact his name specifically where it was linked to possible crimes.\n\nBondi then claimed he administration un-redacted Wexner’s name “within 40 minutes.” But Massie accurately noted that only came after he and Khanna had called it out.\n\n“Within 40 minutes of me catching you red-handed,” Massie clarified.\n\nBondi went on to call Massie a “failed politician” and a “hypocrite.”\n\nWhile Democrats tried to highlight the administration’s missteps on this issue, Bondi was often able to muddy the waters by avoiding the question and getting into shouting matches.\n\nMassie’s exchange actually landed.\n\nFor a brief moment, the lawmakers were reminded of an issue that increasingly inflicts them all. And it brought about a raremoment of real comity.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who has often tussled with Trump-allied witnesses, instead focused on threats that he and his family have faced. After detailing them, he asked Bondi if they were still being investigated.\n\n“I’m just asking for your help to protect life, because life is at risk with the environment we’re in right now,” Swalwell said.\n\nBondi responded: “They are being looked into, and I can give you more details on those. None of you should be threatened ever. None of your children should be threatened. None of your families should be threatened, and I will work with you.”\n\nThe exchange highlighted a sleeping giant of an issue — and one that lawmakers are often reluctant to talk about. But it’s an issue that clearly impacts both sides of the aisle. And for once there was some unity in purpose.\n\nOf course, the two sides have also disagreed vehemently about who is more to blame for political violence — an issue that also came up at another point in the hearing.\n\nThe way these hearings usually work is that the witnesses’ allies on the committee try to guide things in a more favorable direction. So they’ll focus on issues that play to their strengths.\n\nBut those issues were hard to come by.\n\nSome Republicans tried to focus on the Biden Justice Department having subpoenaed the call logs of congressional Republicans — which the GOP has compared to “spying” on them.\n\nBut the hearing literally came a day after we learned the Trump DOJ went a whole lot further with six congressional Democrats — actuallytrying and failing to indict them. These people were, yet again, people Trump suggested deserved to be prosecuted.\n\nBondi focused in her opening remarks on the idea of keeping people safe, citing significantdeclines in crime numbers. And Jordan in his opening statement focused on deportations.\n\nBut those too are issue that seem to have gotten away from the administration. AnNBC News pollreleased earlier in the morning showed Trump’s disapproval on immigration spiking to 60%. And the administration is still dealing with the fallout from its agents having shot and killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis — situations which have also emerged as major liabilities for the administration.\n\nIt was the kind of hearing that could seemingly have used a strong performance, where Bondi directly addressed the issues at hand and tried to right the ship.\n\nBut Bondi didn’t come to answer tough questions. She came to survive the hearing.\n\nBondi, as she has before, came loaded for bear to hit back at lawmakers.\n\nBut the downside of that approach is that sometimes you can miss.\n\nEarly in the hearing, Bondi rather puzzlingly suggested Democrats on the committee should instead focus on how much the stock market has surged under Trump.\n\n“The Dow is over 50,000 right now, the S&P at almost 7,000, and the NASDAQ smashing records, Americans’ 401(k)s and retirement savings are booming,” Bondi said. “That’s what we should be talking about.”\n\nThe stock market is not usually the purview of the Judiciary Committee, which a Democrat quickly pointed out.\n\nLater in the hearing, she attacked Democratic Rep. Becca Balint of Vermont for having voted againsta resolution involving antisemitism.\n\nBut Balint is actually the granddaughter of someone who died in the Holocaust.\n\nBalint pointed that out while shouting at Bondi and imploring her, “Are you serious?” Then Balint stormed out of the hearing.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
