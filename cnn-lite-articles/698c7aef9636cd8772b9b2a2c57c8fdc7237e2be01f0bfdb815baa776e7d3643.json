  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nIt’s been 16 days sinceNancy Guthriewas reported missing, and investigators working the case that has captivated the nation’s attentionare encountering a unique mix of challenges.\n\nThe secluded area in Arizona where Guthrie lives and appears to have been kidnapped in the early morning hours of February 1 continues to present obstacles, as does the intense media scrutiny. More recently, reports of tensions between the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Office dominated headlines.\n\nCNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Millerlaid out what he believes are the three biggest challenges facing investigators as they enter week three of the increasingly frustrating search for the mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie.\n\n“Investigators’ first challenge is, can the victim be located and what is the victim’s condition at this point,” Miller said.\n\nGuthrie is 84 years old, has a pacemaker and requires daily medication, according to authorities and her family. There is no indication Guthrie has received that medication in more than two weeks, as it was left behind when she was apparently taken from her home.\n\n“The victim comes first,” Miller added. “Right now, when it comes to how the victim is, where the victim is, and what condition the victim is in, is a blind spot for (investigators).”\n\nAnother concern is the apparent lack of communication between law enforcement and the Guthrie family with possible kidnappers.\n\n“At this point, the investigators – as far as we know – have lost touch with individuals who were purporting to be the kidnappers. No proof of life has been offered, to our knowledge,” Miller noted, referencing two ransom notes sent to news outlets shortly after Guthrie was first reported missing.\n\nAlthough the authenticity of the notes still has not been verified, the loss of any possible line of communication is not a good sign.\n\nThe influx of tips generated in the case – further fueled by the release this week of footage captured byGuthrie’s doorbell camera– is both good and bad for law enforcement.\n\nInvestigators want as many tips as possible – there arethousands in this case– and history has shown that, sometimes, one tip can change an entire investigation.\n\nBut going through a lot of leads takes a lot of time, even with a large number of personnel involved, and time is not on investigators’ side.\n\nAnd it’s never clear which tip is going to be the one that brings investigators to the right place.\n\n“As we’ve learned time and again, sometimes it is the more obscure lead that may end up further down in the pile that has the answer in it,” Miller said. “The only way to get there is to go through them as fast and thoroughly as possible.”\n\n“This may be the most high-profile kidnapping in America since theLindbergh babybecause of the nature of the victim and the victim’s family,” Miller pointed out, noting Savannah Guthrie’s high profile as an anchor of “Today.”\n\nThere is simply an extraordinary amount of media attention, which brings with it scrutiny and can make it difficult for investigators to hold back information.\n\n“One of the risks to an investigation like this is – much of it has to be done behind the curtain, (and) it’s important that certain things don’t leak out. And under this kind of spotlight, that can become very difficult,” said Miller, who has worked in both local and federal law enforcement.\n\nMedia outlets have largely been cooperative so far, though. “Three different television outlets who received a series of purported ransom notes and demands – possibly real, possibly fake – have been disciplined about not revealing sensitive details about those documents,” Miller said.\n\nStories regarding possible tension between the Pima County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI, even if they are representative of the mood on the ground, can also be harmful to progress, he added.\n\n“None of this is helpful to the atmosphere and progress of the investigation,” Miller said.\n\nOf course, the fishbowl also has a big upside.\n\n“The reason that they’re going to get calls on this case is because of all of the attention,” Miller said.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
