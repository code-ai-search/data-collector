The hydrogen leaks kept cropping up, forcing NASA to halt fuel flow to the rocket multiple times.\n\nThe issue ultimately left the space agencyunable to completethe full test and  led to more than a week of investigations and repairs.\n\nIf pesky hydrogen leaks and a delayed moon mission evoke a sense of déjà vu, it may be because NASA has been through this before.\n\nLiftoff of an uncrewed test flight around the moon in 2022, called Artemis I, was delayed several times then nearly thwarted by similar hydrogen seepage before a team of jumpsuit-clad NASA workers swept in at the11th hourandmanually fixeda leaky valve. There are alsorecordsof engineers struggling with similar issues throughout the Space Shuttle program, which ran from 1981 to 2011.\n\nLeaks are a major concern on the ground: Hydrogen is very easy to ignite and energetic, meaning that too much of it in one area poses the risk of a catastrophic explosion.\n\nSo as launch controllers navigate another “wet dress” rehearsal Thursday, the question remains: Why does NASA keep using this notoriously fickle fuel?\n\nEngineers pioneered the use of hydrogen as rocket fuel in themid-20th centurybefore it was used for the Apollo moon rockets — and most of the launch vehicles that have opted for the fuel since have also wrestled with leaks.\n\nFor example, the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which is produced by US-based military contractor United Launch Alliance and builds on decades of legacy technology, uses hydrogen to power the upper part of its rocket. And in 2023, a fuel leak caused afireball explosionduring Vulcan Centaur testing in Alabama, damaging nearby infrastructure and delaying the rocket’s inaugural launch.\n\nHydrogen’s leaky tendencies can be attributed to the fact that it’s the lightest element in the universe. It “tends to find its way out of things you want to try to contain it in,” said Adam Swanger, a senior principal investigator and cryogenics research engineer at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “And it has very low density.”\n\nTo put that in perspective, hydrogen is roughly14 times lighterthan the air on Earth. But the same properties that make hydrogen so difficult to contain also make it an ideal rocket fuel.\n\n“The low density is good for performance,” Swanger told CNN. “So there’s kind of a trade-off there.”\n\nWhen selecting fuel for a rocket, the most important consideration is a concept called “specific impulse,” often abbreviated as Isp. It’s a measure of how much thrust   — or force — a rocket engine can generate   with a set amount of fuel.\n\nTo calculate the Isp, the predicted thrust of a rocket engine   is divided by the rate at which it expels a propellant’s weight. And weight is crucial in spaceflight: The more power a rocket must use to lift its own weight, the less capacity the vehicle has to haul valuable cargo or people to orbit.\n\nHydrogen is known to have a very favorable specific impulse because it’s so lightweight — and it packs a considerable punch at liftoff. In fact, it’s the best in the business, boasting the highest efficiency of all the rocket fuel options, “which is why we end up using it a lot,” Swanger said.\n\nStill, in the case of Artemis, NASA’s choice of fuel goes beyond just performance.\n\nHydrogen is sometimes considered more trouble than it’s worth, given its propensity to trigger launch delays.\n\nHowever, the fuel also offers the best efficiency advantage when it’s used in the vacuum of space. That’s why some rocket builders opt to use hydrogen for the upper stages of launch vehicles, but make use of a more manageable fuel for a rocket’s first stage, which houses all the engines that give the initial burst of power off the launchpad.\n\nOrbital rockets built by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin or Elon Musk’s SpaceX, for example, make use of alternative fuels — such as methane or RP-1, a type of kerosene — for their rockets’ first stages.\n\nBut NASA’s Artemis moon rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS, uses hydrogen for both the upper and first-stage portions of the vehicle.\n\nAnd there is one not-so-obvious reason why: “It was ultimately a congressional decision that came through via law that NASA had to use Shuttle hardware and Shuttle workforces and contractors to do the SLS,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit Planetary Society.\n\nIn other words, the SLS uses hydrogen in part because the Space Shuttle also used hydrogen, and lawmakers wanted the SLS program to largely preserve the Shuttle-era workforces and supply chains.\n\nThe hydrogen leaks NASA is grappling with today are a symptom of that decision, Dreier added. Opting to attempt to cobble together pieces of an old program for new rockets — rather than starting from scratch — “actually shifted a lot of consequences and cost when it comes to trying to operate the rocket.”\n\nAnd while all rockets that make use of hydrogen are susceptible to frustrating leaks, NASA’s issues with SLS may be exacerbated by its political quirks.\n\n“It’ll never operate as well as if they designed a new rocket,”Dreier said. “It’ll have high overhead costs. And you have finicky rockets.”\n\nNASA has acknowledged that SLS can be finicky. But the vehicle is still in the early days of use after two decades of development.\n\n“It’s an experimental vehicle,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, during a February 3news conferencealongside several other agency officials. “Nobody sitting in one of these chairs needs to be calling any of these vehicles operational.”\n\nNotably, NASA does not typically consider a rocket to be fully “operational” until it enters routine service, a milestone it may take quite some time for SLS to achieve considering how infrequently it flies. Space agency officials only considered the Space Shuttle to be operational, for example, after it completed its first four missions, all of which were flown with crew on board.\n\nKshatriya added that NASA has had a difficult time anticipating the SLS leaks and pinpointing how to prevent them. It’s possible that the process of rolling the rocket out to the launchpad may have contributed to a leaky seal problem engineers are currently troubleshooting, but the agency has not yet confirmed the cause.\n\n“It’s pretty complicated from a stress and strain standpoint. That’s not an excuse,” Kshatriya noted, but engineers have only recently begun hashing out how these issues may develop.\n\nDuring Artemis I as well as the first Artemis II wet dress rehearsal in early February, leaks were located in the same area: the Tail Service Mast Umbilical (TSMU), a three-story-tall structure that connects the SLS rocket to the ground equipment.\n\nTo address the most recent issues found in the TSMU, NASA said technicians recently replaced seals around two of the propellant lines in that area.\n\nTo run a successful “wet dress” test and to keep the rocket safe on launch day, NASA must keep the leak rate during fueling tobelow 16%, according to NASA launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson.\n\nAnd NASA is employing several methods of attempting to stay within the acceptable limits. Apart from working to detect and fix the source of leaks prior to fueling, the agency can also use a technique during the hydrogen loading process that involves briefly warming fuel lines back up, hoping that seals can settle back into a desirable position before they’re plunged back into super-cold temperatures.\n\nSome of the troubleshooting efforts may be paying off, as NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman announced earlier this month that a test in which engineers partially filled SLS’s hydrogen tanks showed improvement. Based on early data reviews, the agency did not observe some of the leaks that troubled the earlier wet dress rehearsal, Isaacmansaid.\n\nNASA’s chronic struggle to contain its fuel of choice within the rocket   raises the question of whether the SLS rocket will always grapple with hydrogen leaks — or if a permanent fix can be found.\n\nKshatriya noted that while an SLS rocket has flown before, the vehicle is not reusable. That means the SLS on the launchpad today is a brand-new, and it may have its own tics and foibles.\n\nThe early February wet dress rehearsal was “the first time this particular machine has borne witness to cryogens,” said Kshatriya, referring to super chilled fuels. “And how it breathes and how it how it vents — and how it wants to leak — is something we have to characterize.”\n\nBut avoiding hydrogen leaks completely may require advancements in material sciences.\n\n“Instead of asking why hydrogen is hard to handle, from a material science point of view, you’re asked, ‘Do any existing materials have good enough fracture toughness?’” explained Jihua Gou, a professor for the University of Central Florida’s department of mechanical and aerospace engineering.\n\nLiquid hydrogen must be kept at the unfathomably frigid temperature of minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. And the infrastructure that contains it needs to be able to withstand frequent chills down to that temperature.\n\n“The biggest problem is the temperature change. And the seals are one thing, but what the seals are attached to also change shape,” noted Swanger, the NASA research engineer.\n\nNASA is currently using Teflon polymers called PTFE, he noted, for those seals.\n\n“Teflon is typically used because that’s historically been the one that works best.   There’s just not a lot of options,” Swanger said. And “it becomes a really challenging problem   with really large interfaces.”\n\nThe SLS rocket, he noted, has specific design limitations. Its enormous size, for example, complicates the search for a permanent hydrogen leak fix because a massive rocket requires a large flow rate for the fuel — increasing the risk of seepage.\n\n“When you add up all these very special requirements, you’re really limited in what you can do,” Swanger said. “I think that if there were a different set of requirements, or you’re starting from scratch — figuring out how we make something that absolutely can’t leak — is probably possible.\n\nBut there is no going back to the drawing board for SLS, he noted, “and it just isn’t really practical to try to do it.”\n\nIf the idea of a hydrogen-propelled vehicle recalls some dangerous incidents, such as theHindenburg disaster, Swanger also emphasized that NASA at least understands how to safely use the sometimes unruly fuel.\n\n“It can absolutely be safely used without a problem, and even with these leaks that we’ve had,” Swanger said, “we’ve never had an accident.”\n\nSee Full Web Article",
