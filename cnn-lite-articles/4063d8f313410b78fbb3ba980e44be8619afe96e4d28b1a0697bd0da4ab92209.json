  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nJim Ratcliffe, the billionaire co-owner of Manchester United, has sparked widespread outrage for claiming the United Kingdom has been “colonized by immigrants,” with club supporters condemning his language as dangerous and divisive and the prime minister demanding an apology.\n\nRatcliffe, who founded petrochemical company Ineos and is one of Britain’s richest men, apologized in a statement Thursday for his “choice of language” — but only after a storm of outrage that drew in senior politicians and soccer fans alike.\n\n“I don’t think the (British) economy is in a good place,” Ratcliffe told Sky News on Wednesday. “You can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonized. It’s costing too much money. The UK has been colonized by immigrants, really, hasn’t it?”\n\nHe cited incorrect population figures, claiming Britain’s population had risen from 58 million in 2020 to 70 million people today. In reality, the population has increased from 67 million in 2020 to 69.5 million people, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nRatcliffe’s remarks prompted widespread criticism, including from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called on him to apologize. StarmersaidRatcliffe’s comments were “offensive and wrong” and that “Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.”\n\nIn a Thursdaystatement, Manchester United said it “prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club,” adding that it “reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.”\n\nThe Football Association, English soccer’s governing body, will examine whether his comments brought the game into disrepute, according to the PA Media news agency.\n\nRatcliffe said he was sorry that his choice of language had offended people, but he added that “it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.”\n\nCNN has contacted Ineos for comment.\n\nRatcliffe, who is the seventh-richest man in Britain with a net worth of around £17 billion ($23 billion) according to the Sunday Times Rich List, moved to tax-free Monaco in 2020.\n\nIn December 2025, his company Ineos accepted a support package from the British government worth over £120 million ($164 million) to prevent its chemical plant in Grangemouth, Scotland, from closing with the loss of 500 jobs. Ineos also invested £150 million ($205 million) into the site.\n\nSuccessive British governments have pledged to reduce immigration, which, as in other Western countries, has become a political flashpoint.\n\nNet migration to the UK reached record levels in 2022, swelled by the war in Ukraine and the post-pandemic lifting of travel restrictions, but it has since dropped off sharply.\n\nRatcliffe’s comments align with arguments made by Britain’s right-wing populist Reform UK party, which ties its anti-immigrant message to language about protecting the country.\n\nResponding to Starmer’s criticism of Ratcliffe’s comments, Reform UK leader Nigel Faragesaid, “Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.”\n\nBut Ratcliffe’s choice of words wascondemnedby Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as “inaccurate, insulting (and) inflammatory.”\n\n“Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city-region, as have the many people working in Greater Manchester’s NHS (National Health Service) and other essential services and industries,” added Burnham, who represents Britain’s ruling Labour Party.\n\nManchester United boasts an enormous global fanbase, and supporter groups expressed anger over Ratcliffe’s comments.\n\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trustsaidthe club “belongs to all of its supporters.”\n\n“No fan should feel excluded from following or supporting the club because of their race, religion, nationality or background,” it added. “Comments from the club’s senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder.”\n\nThe Stretford Sikhs supporters club emphasized immigrants’ contributions to the city of Manchester andwarnedthat “using language that alienates the very people who built this city and support this club is dangerous and divisive.”\n\nAnd the Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club said the use of the word colonized “echoes language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats.”\n\n“Such rhetoric has real-world consequences,” the group added. “The UK has experienced sustained increases in hate crimes in recent years, including rises in Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racially motivated attacks, and hostility towards migrants and people of color.”\n\nSee Full Web Article",
