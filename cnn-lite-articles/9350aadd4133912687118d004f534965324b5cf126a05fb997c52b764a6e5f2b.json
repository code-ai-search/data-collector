  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump will bring guests to theState of the Union addressrepresenting her foster care and responsible AI platforms while President Donald Trump has invited his own set of guests reflecting his priorities – a break from precedent.\n\nThe first lady typically invites guests designed to highlight the themes in the president’s speech, along with her own priorities, offering a blueprint for the remarks. They sit with her in her box in the Capitol, overlooking lawmakers and the president, with cameras trained in their direction at key moments.\n\n“The first lady will have two great children with her as part of her Fostering the Future initiative. The president himself has invited some extraordinary guests this year who, again, truly exemplify what it means to be a patriotic American,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday morning.\n\nSierra Burns, a young woman who grew up in foster care and became an advocate after receiving a voucher from a Melania Trump program, is one of the first lady’s guests.\n\nBurns is pursuing a master’s degree in advocacy and social policy at Furman University in South Carolina and has helped to develop training resources for foster care caseworkers, according to the first lady’s office.\n\nEverest Nevraumont, a 10-year-old advocate for AI education, will also be Melania Trump’s guest, the first lady’s office said. Nevraumontrecently delivereda TEDx Talk about using AI in the classroom at Alpha School Austin, a private school with AI-guided personalized learning. The first lady hascalledfor public- and private-sector leaders to better prepare children for the use of AI technology.\n\n“Sierra and Everest embody my ongoing mission to uplift America’s foster youth and expand opportunity for our next generation through education and technology,” the first lady said in a statement.\n\nThe Trumps’ separate guest lists underscore the independence the first lady has brought to her role.Melania Trumphas spent most of her time away from Washington as her husband has physicallydemolished the East Wing, a space associated for decades with first ladies.\n\nA spokesperson for the first lady did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the reasoning behind the change.\n\nIt’s not the first time Trump has broken with State of the Union tradition. In 2018, the first lady traveled by motorcade to the Capitolseparatelyfrom the president, opting to ride with the guests she invited to share her box.\n\nThe president’s guests, meanwhile, are expected to fill the traditional role of amplifying his agenda: US service members and “everyday Americans who have directly benefited from his policies” will be in attendance, Leavitt said.\n\nThe White House has yet to release a full list of attendees but said a waitress and mother from Pennsylvania who is “directly benefiting from the president’s ‘no tax on tips’ and ‘no tax on overtime’ policies,” is expected to be highlighted during the speech, according to Leavitt.\n\nThose policies were part of President Trump’s signaturedomestic policy agendabill passed last summer.\n\nThe president is also expected to highlight a woman who has saved money with the “TrumpRx” planlaunched earlier this monthas she pursued costly fertility treatments.\n\n“She and her husband have been struggling with infertility, but she’s now saving $3,500 to purchase the drug for infertility to help create a beautiful family for she and her husband,” Leavitt said.\n\nErika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, will be in attendance, Leavitt laterannounced. The president is expected to mention Charlie Kirk’s assassination and condemn political violence during his speech.\n\nTrump will also reference Sage Blair, who becameembroiledin a lawsuit about parental rights and gender transitioning. The president is expected to make a push against transgender care for minors. Last year, the Trump administrationproposednew rules to prohibit hospitals from participating in Medicare and Medicaid if they provide care such as puberty blockers and surgeries for transgender minors.\n\nAnd in what might be one of the more unifying moments in the address, Trump will honor a 100-year-old war veteran, Navy Captain E. Royce Williams, for courage under fire.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
