  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nWendy’s said Friday that it plans to shutter between 5% and 6% of its restaurants in the first half of the year.\n\nThe closures are part of a previously announcedturnaround plan, which the fast-food chain said inNovemberwould includeclosing hundreds of restaurants.\n\nTwenty-eight stores closed during the fourth quarter as part of the plan, interim CEO Ken Cook said during the company’s earnings call.Wendy’s had 5,969 US restaurants at the end of year, according to the company’searnings.\n\nDecisions to close “consistently underperforming restaurants” have been made with Wendy’s franchisees, who can instead focus on stores that may return more profit, Cook added.\n\nThe company has not announced a list of affected stores.\n\nWendy’s US sales are in a slump, with same-store sales falling again during the last quarter of 2025 by 11.3%, according to the company’s earnings. Same-store sales were down 5.6% for the whole year.\n\nCook said Wendy’s has focused too much on limited-time promotions, but is now focusing on everyday value, including changes to its Biggie meals.\n\nWendy’s expanded its Biggie offerings inJanuaryto include the $4 Biggie Bites, a $6 Biggie Bag and an $8 Biggie Bundle. That could appeal to value-conscious consumers who are pulling back on discretionary spending, like eating out, due to inflation pressures.\n\nAnd last year, Cook said its newly released chicken tenders, called “Tendys,” were performing well amid same-store sales declines.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
