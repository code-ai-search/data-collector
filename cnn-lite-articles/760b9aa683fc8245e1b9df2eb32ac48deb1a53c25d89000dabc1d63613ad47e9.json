  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nA former Ukrainian energy minister has been detained in connection with a major corruption scandal while trying to leave the country, authorities said on Sunday.\n\nUkraine’s anti-corruption bureau (NABU) said its detectives “detained the former minister of energy as part of the Midas case,” referencing a wide-ranging investigation into corruption in Ukraine’s energy sector that triggered a major political crisis last year.\n\n“Initial investigative actions are ongoing, carried out in accordance with the requirements of the law,” NABU said.\n\nThe NABU did not name the former minister directly, but said Monday he was in charge between 2021 and 2025. Several Ukrainian media outlets named the minister as German Galushchenko, who was in post during that time period.\n\nThe development comes almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, and as its forces regularly pound Ukraine’s energy infrastructure amidsub-zero temperatures.\n\nThe scandal, which centers on alleged kickbacks from contractors including those working to protect critical energy infrastructure, led both the serving and a former energy minister to resign last year at President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request. Both denied wrongdoing.\n\nChief of staff to the president, Andriy Yermak, alsoresignedamid the fallout.\n\nInvestigators said about $100 million had been siphoned off as state-owned businesses including Energoatom, which operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, paid companies for work done to enhance security at key sites.\n\nAt the time, Ukraine’s anti-corruption body announced it had carried out searches on dozens of properties as part of the investigation.\n\nOn Monday, NABU alleged the former energy minister’s family “invested” in a fund headed by an individual who provided money laundering services, via two companies set up to conceal his involvement.\n\n“It has now been established that over $7.4 million was transferred to the fund’s accounts, which were managed by the suspect’s family,” NABU said. “A further 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.7 million) and 2.4 million euros (around $2.85 million) were paid out in cash and transferred directly to the family in Switzerland.”\n\n“Part of these funds was spent on paying for the children’s education at prestigious institutions in Switzerland,” NABU added.\n\nCorruption allegations are nothing new in Ukraine. Since 2023, NABU has opened investigations into a series of scandals.\n\nIn January 2024, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) said it had discovered amass corruption schemein the purchase of weapons by the country’s military amounting to nearly $40 million.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
