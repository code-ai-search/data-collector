  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nAt least one person was killed and dozens more wounded in explosions that hit the westernUkrainiancity of Lviv early Sunday, in what authorities have labeled a “terrorist attack.”\n\nA 23-year-old policewoman was killed in the attack, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged, the prosecutor’s office said. About two dozen people were wounded, police said.\n\nThe blasts took place as police responded to an emergency phone call about a break-in at a store near the city center, according to Lviv’s regional prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe first occurred after police arrived at the scene, it said, and was followed by another after the arrival of a second crew.\n\nHomemade explosive devices were used in the attack, which had been planted in rubbish bins, according to the Ukrainian National Police, citing preliminary investigations.\n\nLviv’s regional prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into “a terrorist act that caused serious consequences.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that several people had been detained, including an individual suspected of carrying out the attack.\n\nPolice said a 33-year-old woman had been detained in the western city of Staryi Sambir, near the border with Poland. They said the woman was suspected of carring out the attack on the instruction of a handler in Russia.\n\nViktoria Shpylka was named by police as the officer who was killed in the attack.\n\n“Her colleagues remember her as sensitive, bright and sincere. She knew how to support, listen and find a kind word even on the hardest of days,” police said. Shpylka, 23, had married a patrol officer last year, the statement said.\n\nZelensky said Sunday that Russia had used 50 missiles and nearly 300 drones in a widespread barrage against locations across Ukraine overnight.\n\nThe strikes targeted the capital Kyiv and six regions, from Sumy in the north to Odessa on the Black Sea. One person was killed in the Kyiv area, Zelensky said, and eight injured.\n\nIt was the largest number of missiles fired in one night since February 3.\n\nCNN reporters in Kyiv said there had been multiple detonations around the capital overnight.\n\nZelensky said the Russian strikes were focusing on the country’s energy infrastructure, as well as railway and water supply networks.\n\n“This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones,” Zelensky said.\n\n“We need systems that effectively counter ballistic threats,” he added.\n\nOne Russian missile strike targeted a factory in northern Ukraine owned by US multinational Mondelez that makes snacks and chocolate.\n\n“This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy,” Foreign Minister Andrii Sybihasaidin a X post.\n\nFour Moscow airports briefly restricted flights, Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia said Sunday. The restrictions came as Moscow’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin said the city was targeted by a wave of Ukrainian drones – a claim Kyiv has not publicly commented on.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
