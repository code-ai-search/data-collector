Hillary Clinton will appear today, with the former president set to testify Friday. The depositions will be videotaped and GOP committee staffers plan to release the footage within days of the interviews. Hillary Clinton has said she never met Epstein. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, traveled on Epstein’s private plane at least 16 times,according to a CNN review, and was pictured with women in a jacuzzi in files released by the Justice Department.

The talks come amid heightened regional tensions, including ongoing protests inside Iran and mounting concerns about possible military escalation as theUS builds up its forces in the Middle East. In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump accused Iran of once again “pursuing their sinister ambitions” and faulted its leaders for refusing to say “those secret words: ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’” Iran, however, has repeatedly said it is not seeking to develop nuclear arms.\n\nThe Trump administration is withholding more than $250 million in Medicaid funds from Minnesota, claiming widespread fraud as it ramps up pressure on the state’s Democratic leadership.
