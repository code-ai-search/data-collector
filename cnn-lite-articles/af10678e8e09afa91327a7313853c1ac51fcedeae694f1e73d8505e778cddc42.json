  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan are fighting again, trading deadly shelling and mortar fire across their rugged border, with Islamabad’s defense minister saying his country’s patience had “run out” and declaring “open war” on its Taliban-run neighbor.\n\nIt’s the latest flare-up in an on-off conflict that pitches Pakistan’s well-funded, powerful and nuclear-armed military against hardened Afghan Taliban fighters with decades of battle experience – including victory over US and NATO forces in 2021 after years of insurgency.\n\nHere’s what we know about the latest violence, which threatens to exacerbate instability in the region.\n\nLate Thursday night the Taliban’s military launched attacks on Pakistani positions along some sections of their porous and disputed border that wends 1,600 miles through rugged mountains and desert.\n\nKabul said those attacks were in retaliation for Pakistan’sbombingof what it said were militant camps in Afghanistan over the weekend that left at least 18 people dead.\n\nIn response, early on Friday, Pakistan launched Ghazab Lil Haqq – or “Operation Righteous Fury.”\n\nPakistani airstrikes had hit Kabul, the southeastern province of Paktia, and Kandahar, considered the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban where the group’ssecretive leader Hibatullah Akhundzadais believed to be based.\n\nPakistan said its strikes early Friday targeted Afghan Taliban defense facilities, a significant escalation in the country’s retaliation strategy.\n\nA Kabul resident described the moment her family was woken by a loud explosion on Friday.\n\n“I was terrified,” the woman, who CNN is not naming for safety reasons, said.\n\n“Then we heard gunfire. When we looked out of our apartment window, we saw bullet-like flames going up in the sky,” she said, adding she could not sleep and was still awake at 5 a.m., fearing what could happen next.\n\n“Since the first explosion, the lights of most of the houses and apartments around us have been on,” the woman said. “I’m sure every Kabul resident is sitting in fear of being hit by a bomb.”\n\nThe two sides have reported differing casualty figures for Friday’s attack. Pakistan claimed that its military had killed 133 Afghan Taliban fighters, while Afghanistan said eight of its soldiers had been killed. CNN isn’t able to verify reports from the remote region where the fighting is taking place.\n\nIn Pakistan’s northwestern Bajaur district, a mortar shell fired by the Afghan Taliban landed on a house, injuring five people, including two children and a woman, according to police officer, Fazal Akbar.\n\nYes. Despite sharing close economic and cultural ties, the two countries have a complicated history.\n\nLast October, they fought their deadliest conflict in years, with a fragile ceasefire in place since.\n\nAfter the Afghan Taliban was ousted from power by NATO forces in 2001 for sheltering the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks, Pakistan became one of its main backers.\n\nIts fighters found shelter over the border in Pakistan, and support for their subsequent insurgency against the US-backed Afghan government, in what became the US’ longest-ever war.\n\nBut since the Taliban’s ultimate victory in that war following the chaotic US withdrawal and their return to power in Kabul, Pakistan has faced a surge in Islamist violence.\n\nIslamabad blames Pakistani Taliban militants for much of that violence – and accuses Kabul of giving them shelter on its territory.\n\nMany of those attacks are carried out with US weapons left behind during the chaotic withdrawal,CNN has reported. The Afghan Taliban denies hosting its Pakistani namesake.\n\nMore than 1,200 people, including military and civilians, were killed in militant attacks across the country in 2025, according to data shared with CNN by the Pakistani military. That’s double the number recorded in 2021, when the US retreated from Kabul and the Afghan Taliban returned to power.\n\nMany Afghan Taliban figures still have property and families in Pakistan, the country’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN in November. When asked by CNN if the current spike in violence was the definition of blowback, he replied “Yeah, I think so.”\n\nAsif took to social media early Friday to accuse Afghanistan of gathering “all the terrorists of the world” and “exporting terrorism,” while depriving its own people of human rights.\n\n“Our patience has run out,” Asif wrote on X. “Now it is open war between us and you.”\n\nBy the numbers, the disparity between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries is stark, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ (IISS) “Military Balance 2025.”\n\nThe military remains Pakistan’s most powerful institution, having solidified its dominance throughout the country’s history with coups and constitutional amendments.\n\nAs a nuclear power, Pakistan commands a sophisticated defense apparatus comprising an army, navy, air force, and marine corps. According to the IISS, these branches total approximately 660,000 active-duty troops, reinforced by paramilitary and military police units numbering nearly 300,000 personnel.\n\nTheir conventional strength is bolstered by a modern arsenal, including US-made F-16 fighter jets, French Mirage jets, and the JF-17, jointly produced with China, Islamabad’s primary defense partner.\n\nIn contrast, Afghanistan possesses a singular, unified force: the Taliban.\n\nEstimated at fewer than 200,000 personnel, the Taliban’s military structure lacks a functional air force, relying instead on a handful of aging Soviet-era attack helicopters and transport aircraft abandoned during the US withdrawal as well as quadcopter drones.\n\nWhile they lack the heavy weaponry of their neighbors, their guerilla tactics are a defining characteristic of their military identity, hardened by their ideological rigidity, religious fervor and decades of asymmetric warfare.\n\nPrevious flare-ups have calmed after days of fighting, and mediation by foreign governments including Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nAnalysts fear further escalation could compound instability.\n\n“Pakistan has made clear it will act again if the Afghan Taliban fail to move against TTP leaders and fighters on Afghan soil,” said Samina Ahmed, the Crisis Group’s senior project director for South Asia and senior Asia adviser.\n\n“Islamabad and Kabul should urgently resume negotiations, with facilitation from trusted partners such as Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.”\n\nSee Full Web Article",
