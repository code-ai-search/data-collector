The news came shortly afterIran claimedits leaders were “safe and sound.”\n\nThis satellite image from Airbus shows black smoke rising from the compound of Iran’s supreme leader in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Damage seen in the image appears to show that several buildings in the compound were hit by strikes, after the US and Israel launched joint attacks.\n\nAs of Saturday night local time, Iran’s internet connectivity had dropped to about 4% following the strikes.\n\nData from Flightradar24 shows virtually no flight traffic over Iran and other Middle Eastern countries after the strikes. This graphic compares air traffic from a week ago to traffic on Saturday evening, local time.\n\nChristian Edwards, Karina Tsui, Tim Lister, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
