  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nThe estate ofJeffrey Epsteinagreed on Thursday to pay up to $35 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by survivors of the late convicted sex offender.\n\nThe complaint, which was first filed in 2024, alleges that Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, co-executors of Epstein’s estate, “facilitated” Epstein’s “sex trafficking and abuse” and “were also integral in allowing Epstein to escape justice for years by concealing his litany of crimes.”\n\nIndyke and Kahn denied the allegations in Thursday’s filing, adding that they were not involved in “the Epstein sex trafficking venture in any way” and that they do not believe “any Class Member has suffered any harm, injury, or damages as a result of their conduct.” The settlement would resolve all claims against the two defendants and the estate. A judge must now sign off on the agreement.\n\nIt comes amid the fallout from the Justice Department’s release of millions of pages of files related to Epstein in document dumps over the course of the last year. The files include numerousprominent names, and revelations have promptedseveral executives to step down.\n\nThe parties agreed on a settlement of up to $35 million, according to a court filing Thursday. The final figure depends on the number of survivors that signed onto the class-action lawsuit, and it could be as low as $25 million if there are less than 40 “Eligible Class Members.”\n\nAn attorney for Indyke and Kahn stressed that they are not admitting to any wrongdoing by agreeing to the settlement.\n\n“Neither of the co-executors has made any admission or concession of misconduct,” lawyer Daniel Weiner said in a statement to CNN. “Because they did nothing wrong, the co-executors were prepared to fight the claims against them through to trial, but agreed to mediate and settle this lawsuit in order to achieve finality as to any potential claims against the Epstein Estate.”\n\nCNN has reached out to lawyers representing the survivors.\n\nSeveral survivors have already received compensation since Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 while awaiting his sex trafficking trial.\n\nIn November 2019, attorneys for Epstein’s estate executors filed a request to pursue a survivor compensation fund to avoid litigation and the program started in June 2020. By early 2021,payouts were pausedbecause the estate was low on cash. Before the pause, over 150 claims were filed and the program paid out over $50 million to eligible claimants.\n\nSurvivors have also reached settlements with two banks where Epstein was a client:JP Morgan Chase, which agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class-action lawsuit, andDeutsche Bank, which reached a $75 million settlement.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
