  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nThousands in the Northeast remained without power amid freezing temperatures Tuesday as people from that region and the mid-Atlantic dug out from extreme snowfall — including more than 2 feet in several states — from the previous two days and faced continuing travel disruptions including hundreds of canceled flights.\n\nTemperatures in much of the Northeast are not expected to climb above freezing Tuesday, so snow melting may be limited.\n\nThe storm﻿, which began Sunday night, hit bomb cyclone status in the early hours of Monday as it strengthened extremely quickly, ramping winds tohurricane-force gusts, intensifying snow bands and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands. Local officials echoedstate of emergencydeclarations and issuedtravel banswhile the tens of millions of people underblizzard warningshunkered down.\n\nOf the more than 225,000 customers still without power in the region Tuesday night, more than 190,000 were in Massachusetts, the vast majority of whom were customers of the Eversource utility company in southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, according toPowerOutage.us.\n\n“It will take days” to turn on the lights for every Massachusetts customer, an Eversource official said.\n\n“It is a multiday restoration,” Doug Foley, Eversource’s president of electric operations in Massachusetts, said at a news conference Tuesday. “The last couple customers, unfortunately, will be a couple days out.”\n\nThose who do dig out of the snow may have trouble going anywhere despiteeasing travel bans, withpublic transit delays,icyroad conditionsandflight cancellationsacross the region.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. ET, just over 2,200 US flights had been canceled Tuesday,according to FlightAware. The vast majority of those flights had been scheduled to arrive at or depart from the four major northeastern airports — Newark; Boston; and LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy in New York — which were still recovering Tuesday from the storm.\n\nAmong those hoping to fly out Tuesday was Alyssa Myers, whose flight from Philadelphia to Albuquerque on Sunday afternoon was canceled. She rebooked and canceled several times.\n\n“If you don’t have to go, cancel the trip, get the refund, wait for warmer weather,” Myers told CNN’s Danny Freeman at Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nThe historic storm yielded numerous impacts as schoolsacross the regionclosed, both the US House and Senatepostponedthis week’s first vote series, major train routes wereadjusted,public transitwas paused and even the popular food delivery serviceDoorDash suspended its operationsin the country’s biggest city.\n\nThough the storm dwindled by Monday evening, a forecast for more looms.
