Airlines internationally announced canceled and disrupted flights to the Middle East on Saturday.\n\nVirgin Atlantic announced it had canceled its flight from London Heathrow to Dubai on Saturday, as “a precautionary measure.”\n\nLufthansa confirmed cancellations of flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel, citing the safety of passengers and crew members.\n\nBritish Airways said it was cancelling flights to and from Tel Aviv and Bahrain for several days.
