Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOMwrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike.\n\nAt least 148 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of Operation Southern Spear, a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking.\n\nFriday’s boat strike marks the sixth publicly known attack of the year and the second attack this week. The US military on Tuesdayconducted a strikeon three alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, killing 11 people, according to US Southern Command.\n\nOngoing military action in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean has been met with intense scrutiny in Congress since the operations began last September.\n\nPrior to the US military’s campaign of boat strikes, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, and cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights.  The Coast Guard hascontinued to interdictdrug-trafficking vessels and seizing narcotics in the eastern Pacific without the use of lethal force.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
