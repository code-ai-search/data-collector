  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nOlympic figure skater Alysa Liu has earned her stripes.\n\n“I feel good, I feel confident and I put it all out there,” the 20-year-oldsaidThursdayafterwinning America’s first gold medalin the Winter Olympics’ women’s free skating event since 2002.\n\nBut before becoming a champion, Liu had already given herself a crown of sorts, sporting a captivating hairstyle known as “halo hair” to make her podium intentions clear.\n\nHer iteration of the style features horizontal brunette stripes interrupted by milk-tea-colored rings, with bright blonde transitional lines.\n\n“Revived halos, who dis?” Liu captioned an Instagrampostlast month that she showed off her refreshed tree ring hairstyle.\n\n“OMG SO GOOD,” commented fellow US figure skater Bradie Tennell, with a fire emoji.\n\nLiu’s hairstylist Kelsey Miller also gave the skater her flowers when sharing various images onInstagramof the “angel halos,” describing her clientas “an inspiration.”\n\n“I hope the world never lets you down or tries to take your sparkle away from you!” Miller said, adding that she “can’t wait to see those halos spin on the ice tonight.”\n\nMiller said in an Instagramreelon Wednesday that she was “shocked” after receiving a request from Liu, who wanted her gingery tree rings turned a milk tea color, which is closer to platinum blonde.\n\n“Usually, I do it like a gingery color, but I was like, I want something different. Like, I want it lighter,” Liu toldNBCin January, adding that she ended up at the salon in St. Louis, Missouri, because she couldn’t get it as light as she desired with her usual DIY approach.\n\nStarting the style in 2023, Liu said she adds a stripe every year, which is why she now parades three rings in her hair.\n\n“So, it’s going to be like this for a year and then next year, wintertime, like end of December, I do another ring,” Liu added.\n\nMeaning, soon enough, she could have the five rings symbolic of the Olympic Games.\n\nYet, wait for her to grin and another striking ring-shape is very clear – but this gem is in her mouth.\n\nHanging over the skater’s front teeth, Liu has what’s known as the “smiley” piercing, which goes through her frenulum, the thin tissue between the upper lip and gum, and is visible when she smiles.\n\nThe self-belief that drove her to be a champion on ice is no better highlighted than in her dauntless piercing experience.\n\nLiu toldTMJ4 Newsthat she got the piercing about two years ago, saying it was painless. “I did it myself,” she said, adding her sister helped and held up her lip.\n\nAnd Liu is not only Olympianshowcasing individuality and expression during the Winter Games.\n\nOlympic nailshave been seen clasping medals on more than one occasion.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdamshowed off her manicurefeaturing white Olympic rings after winning gold last week.\n\nAnother version, featuring gold stars, was also spotted on the nails of Chinese silver-winning freestyle skier Eileen Gu.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
