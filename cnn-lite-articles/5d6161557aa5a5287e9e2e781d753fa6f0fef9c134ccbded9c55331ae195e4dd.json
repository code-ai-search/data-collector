  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nThe US military conducted a strike againstanother alleged drug-trafficking boatin the Caribbean on Friday, killing three people, according to US Southern Command.\n\n“On Feb. 13, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOMwrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike.\n\nAt least 124 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of Operation Southern Spear, a campaign the Trump administration says is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking.\n\nThe administration has labeled those killed as “unlawful combatants” and claimed the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review due to aclassified Justice Department finding.\n\nFriday’s boat strike is the fourth publicly known attack of the year. A strike earlierthis weekkilled two people and left one survivor, with the US Coast Guard providing technical support for search and rescue operations coordinated by Maritime Rescue Coordination Center Ecuador.\n\nThe administration has publicly presented little evidence that those killed in Operation Southern Spear are affiliated with drug cartels, or that each of the vessels had drugs on them.\n\nThe legality of the strikes has also come under intense scrutiny in Congress since the operations began in September. There is particular interest in the first attack on September 2, which included a follow-up strike that killed two crew members who had initially survived. Multiple current and former military lawyers previously told CNN the strikes do not appear lawful.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
