  "text": "Source: CNN\n\nRarely does such a powerful, blockbuster winter storm nearly sneak up on the most populous urban corridor in the US. But that’s what happened this weekend.\n\nAs of Friday, forecast models still disagreed on whether theNortheast blizzardwould be a blockbuster for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. It wasn’t until Saturday morning that the models really started to align on it being of potentially historic magnitude — and even then, there was still far more uncertainty than normal.\n\nFrom that time onward, meteorologists were hammering on the forecast, increasing snowfall totals, wind speeds and the overall threat level to make sure people knew the seriousness of what was coming in less than 48 hours.\n\nAlthough the end result is likely to be fewer deaths and injuries than might have occurred had officials not been on top of the situation, declaring state of emergencies and taking other escalatory steps, the fact is that the forecast left a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy in advance.\n\nForecasters were also fighting an uphill battle. Social science research has shown that people tend to cling to the first forecast they hear for a storm, even after it changes. This can occasionally prove deadly, as in thecase of Hurricane Ianin 2022, when some Floridians did not flee areas that were especially threatened by the storm’s shifting track.\n\nIn this case, the first forecast people heard in the Northeast was that the storm would likely miss their area, but with the caveat that they should keep attuned to the latest forecasts, in case things were to change.\n\nAnd yikes, the details sure did change.\n\nIn many ways, the forecast chaoswas equivalent to another familiar situation: when a hurricane rapidly intensifies as it approaches land, catching people off guard who may have prepared for a weaker storm. The storm itself was also similar to a hurricane, with winds gusting up to 84 mph, snow piling higher than two feet in some spots, and blizzard conditions from the Delmarva to Boston.\n\nRapidly changing forecasts present unique challenges for forecasters, weather communicators and public officials alike. Instead of having several days to get used to the complexities of a forecast and prepare the public, governors and mayors only had about two days to message the increasing seriousness of this event.\n\nThey seemed to have succeeded in doing so, with airlines canceling thousands of flights in advance of the wintry onslaught, city and state travel bans going into effect prior to the arrival of the worst conditions and other steps taken to ensure the public’s safety during this event.\n\nIt could have been a lot worse, given the scenario: a rapidly changing forecast, a historically intense storm taking a textbook-perfect track to slam the I-95 corridor and increasingly urgent public safety messaging.\n\nWinter and even hurricane history is replete with bungled responses in cities like New York, where former Mayor Michael Bloomberg famously dismissed the threat posed by Superstorm Sandy once it was no longer formally referred to as a hurricane.\n\nSnowstorms can make or break a mayor’s career, and in New York City, newly crowned mayor Zohran Mamdani sought to get ahead of this one and clearly communicate the dire threat it posed to public safety. This storm was also an early test of newly sworn in governors in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nThere are many soundscientific reasons for the enduring forecast uncertaintyin this situation, including opposing computer model projections in the context of a complex weather pattern.\n\nBut with all the tools available to forecasters today, including the advent of AI-driven computer models, one would hope this storm’s last-minute forecasting proves to be a rarity, not the rule.\n\nBecause in hindsight, there was a lot of luck that played into the public’s preparations for this storm, with forecasters in the uncomfortable position of rapidly ratcheting up their warnings with precious little preparation time to spare.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
