In the US, that figure was 45%.\n\nAnd the surveys put most of the blame for that sense of doom on Trump.\n\nAsked if the US president’s policies are good for the world, half or more of the respondents in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Brazil and South Africa said they slightly or strongly disagreed.\n\nThe Munich Security Conference runs Friday through Sunday in the Bavarian city. More than 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend, according to the event’s website.\n\nTrump, however, is not going. The US will be represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and by more than 50 members of Congress, conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger said, according to a Reuters report.\n\nSee Full Web Article",
